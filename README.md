# The Cook App üç≥

**The Cook App** is the world's first open-source, collaboration-driven recipe community platform. Inspired by GitHub, we empower food lovers and professional chefs to share, remix, and evolve recipes together, preserving culinary heritage and making home cooking accessible to everyone.

## üöÄ Vision

Our goal is to build a global platform where anyone can:

- **Share** their recipes in a structured, standard format
- **Fork** and **remix** recipes to create new variations
- **Track** every recipe's version history
- **Collaborate** with others to improve and innovate
- **Exchange** culinary knowledge and culture

## üåü Core Features

- **Open Collaboration**: Fork, edit, and propose changes to any recipe.
- **Version Control**: View the full history of every recipe, just like code commits.
- **Structured Data**: Recipes are stored in [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) or other standard markup formats for easy parsing and sharing.
